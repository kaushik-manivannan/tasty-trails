# Tasty Trails: A Community Food Sharing Platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to Tasty Trails, a purpose-driven web application designed to foster community collaboration and reduce food waste. Tasty Trails provides a platform for users to share information about surplus food, creating a better environment where everyone can contribute to minimizing food wastage. 

For users, Tasty Trails means more than just access to surplus food; it's an opportunity to discover and enjoy delicious meals while promoting sustainability in the community. Our primary goal is to target those in need, ensuring that both food providers and recipients find mutual benefit through this platform. By connecting surplus food providers with those facing food insecurity, Tasty Trails strives to create a space where every shared meal makes a meaningful impact on individuals and communities.
