# Tasty Trails: A Community Food Sharing Platform

## Project Overview

Welcome to Tasty Trails, a purpose-driven web application designed to foster community collaboration and reduce food waste. Tasty Trails provides a platform for users to share information about surplus food, creating a better environment where everyone can contribute to minimizing food wastage. 

For users, Tasty Trails means more than just access to surplus food; it's an opportunity to discover and enjoy delicious meals while promoting sustainability in the community.
